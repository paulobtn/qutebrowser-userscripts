#My userscripts for qutebrowser

My browser of choice is Qutebrowser and one of the reasons is a nice native support for
Greasemonkey userscripts where I can create custom behaviour for individual pages.
In this repository I will dump my personal configuration, don't expect major documentations.

To use these scripts, place them in the directory: 
```bash
~/.local/share/qutebrowser/greasemonkey/
```

## link-to-invidious
Adds a redirect button in youtube videos to an [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) instance.
Invidious is a light privacy focused client for youtube.

## block-yt-ads
