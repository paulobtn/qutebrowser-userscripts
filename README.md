# My userscripts for qutebrowser

My browser of choice is [Qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser) and one of the reasons is the really nice native support for
[Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) userscripts where I can create custom behaviour for individual pages.
In this repository I will dump my personal configuration. Use it if you want and don't expect major documentations.

To use these scripts, place them in the directory: 
```bash
~/.local/share/qutebrowser/greasemonkey/
```

## link-to-invidious
